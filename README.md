### Team Name: stomach pain

## Focus

Our idea is to create an abstract art representation of user uploaded files. Users will create accounts and upload resumes (pdfs), and generate interactive/animated absttact art with different styles based on quantifications from the resume. This could include information such as user contact info, employment information (dates, companies, buzz words, quantifications).

On the backend, there will be use of pdf parsing and form recognizing technology to extract quantitative values from the texts in order to generate images. There will also be full text searching capabilities to find all images generated from relevant text.
